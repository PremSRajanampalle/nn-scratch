In this project, i implemented a neural network, using just numpy and pandas, on MNIST dataset. 

Conclusion:
1. after 5000 epochs, for the training set, the accuracy is 0.9027777777777778
2. upon learning the parameters during training, and after implementing the same on testind dataset, the accuracy was found to be 0.9042666666666667
...which is pretty good.
